- 👋 Hi, I’m Sagnik De, a third-year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the distinguished
 Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (IRPE), University of Calcutta, India.
 I consider myself immensely fortunate to have been graced with invaluable guidance and mentorship from esteemed researchers over the years.
Currently, I am working as an intern in Carnegie Mellon University under the supervison of Prof. Min Xu, where my work revolves around the visualization and analysis of
RNAscope™ images. During a prior period, I dedicated my summer semester break at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, where I worked with Prof. Sankar Kumar Pal
(recepient of Padma Shri in Science and Engineering, 2013) on conceptualization and implementation of a Multiclass Deep Sort, coupled with the development of a
Granulated Region-Based CNN. These innovative frameworks were meticulously designed to advance the domain of object tracking. I have also worked extensively with P
rof. Anisha Halder Roy on various Human-Computer Interface tasks. Additionally, I have gained experience as an intern at C-DAC, Pune, working under the guidance of
Dr. Anil Kumar Gupta. Further, during the Winter semester break, I was priviledged to work at Applied AI Research Lab, USD under the guidance of Prof. KC Santosh.
