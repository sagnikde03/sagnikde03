### About Me:- 
I'm a 3rd year UG student at Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (IRPE), [University of Calcutta, Kolkata](https://www.caluniv.ac.in). My research interests revolve around various interdisciplinary areas within computer science, with a particular focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interactions (HCI), Computer Vision and Image/Video Processing . I am deeply fascinated by the potential of these fields to shape the future of technology and transform the way we interact with machines and information.
